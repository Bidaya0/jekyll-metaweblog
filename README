## jekyll-metaweblog

A stand-alone server that will expose a Jekyll source folder via the Blogger / MT / Wordpress XML-RPC metaweblog interface, allowing you to create/edit/delete posts and pages using a GUI client, such as Marsedit.



### Usage

  ruby server.rb --port 4040 /path/to/jekyll/folder

Then point your weblog client to http://localhost:4040/ and start editing.


### TODO

* username/password support, so it's safe to run on a remote server

* run the jekyll processor in the same process, so you can run a single command line that will build your blog _and_ expose it to GUI clients.

* file upload support

* add support for clients that aren't Marsedit (by actually trying them)

* finish page support

* fix all the bugs. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
